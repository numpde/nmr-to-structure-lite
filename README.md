Adapted from "multimodal-spectroscopic-dataset" and "nmr-to-structure" by rxn4chemistry

This repo is intended to be a lightweight repo
that can be cloned onto a GPU machine to train
the NMR-to-Structure (peak-to-smiles) model
a la [Alberts et al](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/nmr-to-structure).
